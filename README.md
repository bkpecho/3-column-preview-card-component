## My process

### Built with

- HTML: Used for creating the structure and content of the website.
- BEM Naming Convention: Used to write modular, reusable CSS classes that are easy to read and maintain.
- Sass: Used to preprocess CSS and add advanced features like variables, nesting, and mixins to improve the maintainability and scalability of the codebase.
- Flexbox: Used for layout and positioning of elements on the page, providing a flexible and intuitive way to arrange content.
- Mobile-first workflow: Adopted a mobile-first approach to design and development, prioritizing the experience on smaller devices and scaling up to larger ones.
- Semantic HTML5 markup: Used HTML5 elements that describe the content of the page, making it more accessible to users and search engines.

### What I learned

BEM Naming Convention: By using the BEM methodology, I was able to write CSS that is more modular and maintainable. This helped me to organize my code and make it easier to read and understand.

Sass: I learned how to use Sass to preprocess my CSS and take advantage of features like variables, nesting, and mixins. This allowed me to write more efficient and scalable code, while reducing redundancy and improving readability.
